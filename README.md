# Taxi Statements Generator

Generate printable EFTPOS and Taxi Service Subsidy (TSS) statements from CSV input files via a simple local web app. The project bundles a Flask backend, ReportLab-powered PDF generation, and a PyInstaller build script for creating a portable Windows executable.

## Features

- Upload multiple raw CSV exports and group them automatically per taxi.
- Produce two report styles:
  - **EFTPOS statement** with detailed payment breakdowns.
  - **Taxi TSS statement** with the simplified six-column layout.
- Landscape A4 PDF output with branding, period headers, and totals.
- Portable build (`TaxiStatements.exe`) that end users can double-click without installing Python.

## Project layout

```
app.py                # Flask application and upload/report endpoints
report_generator.py    # CSV parsing and ReportLab PDF rendering
static/                # Branding assets (e.g., logo.png)
templates/             # HTML templates for the web UI
dist/                  # PyInstaller build output (ignored by git)
build_exe.bat          # Convenience script to rebuild the executable
requirements.txt       # Python dependencies
```

The folders `uploads/`, `output/`, `dist/`, `build/`, and `Raw Data/` are ignored by git so you can keep local data and builds without committing them.

## Prerequisites

- Windows with PowerShell (build script targets Windows on x64).
- Python 3.13 (or edit the virtual environment to use another supported version).
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control.

## Getting started

```powershell
# clone the repo once it exists on GitHub
git clone https://github.com/<your-account>/<repo-name>.git
cd <repo-name>

# create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# run the Flask dev server
python app.py
```

Navigate to <http://127.0.0.1:5000> to upload CSV files and generate PDFs. Output files are written to the `output/` directory.

## Building the portable executable

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
.\build_exe.bat
```

The launcher `TaxiStatements.exe` will be placed in `dist\TaxiStatements\`. Zip that folder, move it to another machine, and double-click the executable to run the app.

## Creating the GitHub repository

1. Sign in to GitHub and create a new **empty** repository (no README or .gitignore) named whatever you prefer.
2. In this project folder, initialise git and make the first commit:

    ```powershell
    cd "C:\EFT TSS Report Programming"
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```

3. Add the GitHub remote and push:

    ```powershell
    git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-account>/<repo-name>.git
    git branch -M main
    git push -u origin main
    ```

Replace `<your-account>` and `<repo-name>` with your GitHub username and repository name. After pushing, the code will appear on GitHub for collaborators or deployment pipelines.

If you want sample CSV files for demos, copy them into `Raw Data/` locallyâ€”they will stay out of version control thanks to the `.gitignore` entry.
